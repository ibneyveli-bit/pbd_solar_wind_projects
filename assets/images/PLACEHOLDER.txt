Please add battery_storage.jpg to this directory.

The BESS card is configured to show a background image, but the file is missing.

To fix this:
1. Add your battery storage container image here as "battery_storage.jpg"
2. Run: flutter clean && flutter pub get
3. The BESS card will then show the background image

Until then, the BESS card will show with a green gradient background.
